## Features

List of implemented features:
* Authentication
* Form validation
* PUT and GET  requests to a [Firebase RealTime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database).
* Lazy loading
* Nested routes
* Pass data with route parameters

List of possible improvements:

* Automatically GET the data from the database after being logged in, and also automatically  POST and PUT new recipes and changes made to them , without the need of clicking the `fetch` and `save` buttons from the `Manage` dropdown menu.
* Store each user's recipes and shopping list items in a separate collection, because now it's a shared database between all users.

## Status

Project is _finished_.
